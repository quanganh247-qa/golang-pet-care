## Project Documentation

### Overview
This project is a React Native mobile application backed by a robust server-side architecture built with Go, PostgreSQL, and Redis, deployed using Docker. The architecture ensures efficient user management, secure authentication, and high-performance data processing.

The system integrates third-party services like JWT for token management, Gmail for email notifications, and a custom REST API for seamless client-server communication.
